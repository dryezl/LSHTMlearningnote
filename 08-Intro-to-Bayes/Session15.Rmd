> Many statistical models also have anterograde amnesia. As the models move from one cluster - individual, group, location - in the data to another, estimating parameters for each cluster, they forget everything about the previous cluster. ... These models implicitly assume that nothing learned about any one category informs estimates for the other categories -- the parameters are independent of one another and learn from completely separate proportions of the data. This would be like forgetting you had ever been in a cafe, each time you go to a new cafe. Cafes do differ, but they are alsoo alike.
