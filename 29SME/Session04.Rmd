本次練習使用的數據是在坦桑尼亞實施的病例對照研究，數據名是 `mwanza.dta`。你可以使用 `help mwanza` 來進一步瞭解這個研究和數據的各個變量。

## Q1 數據讀入

按照要求生成兩個變量：

1. `ed2`: 1 = 表示未接受過教育; 2 = 接受過1年以上的正規教育。
2. `age2`: 1 = 15-24; 2 = 25-34; 3 = 35+ 歲


```{r SME06-01stata,  engine='stata', cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cd "~/Downloads/LSHTMlearningnote/backupfiles/"
use mwanza

* create a new variable for education
generate ed2 = ed
recode ed2 3/4 = 2
label define ed2label 1 "none/adult only" 2 ">=1 years"
label val ed2 ed2label
label var ed2 "education"

* check the recoding worked as wanted
tabulate ed2 ed


* similarly for age 

generate age2 = age1
recode age2 2 = 1 3/4 = 2 5/6 = 3
label define age2label 1 "15-24" 2 "25-34" 3 "35+"
label val age2 age2label
label var age2 "Age"
tabulate age2 age1

Case control study of risk factors for HIV in women, Mwanza Tanzania  
     
As part of a prospective study of the impact of STD control on the incidence
of HIV infection in Mwanza, Tanzania, a baseline survey of HIV prevalence was
carried out in 12 communities. All seropositive women (15 years and above)
were revisited and, where possible) interviewed about potential risk factors
for HIV infection using a standard questionnaire. In addition to interviewing
HIV +ve women, a random sample of HIV -ve women were selected from the
population lists prepared during the baseline survey and these women were also
revisited and, where possible, interviewed. No matching of controls with cases
was performed.
